          <h2>What I've Worked On</h2>
        </header>

        <p>My development experience has centered around WordPress, but I've become fasinated with Jekyll as of late.</p>

        <p>I typically build WordPress sites with the Genesis Framework so I built a starter theme I call <a href="https://github.com/bradonomics/genesis-boilerplate">Genesis Boilerplate</a> that includes my most used functions and my preferred Gulp setup. You can read more about my process on <a href="{{ site.url }}/genesis-boilerplate/">my blog</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm not overly excited about how much Javascript is being used in front-end design and as a result haven't spent much time learning it but I can make my way around a few libraries. In an effort to improve my knowledge I built a shopping cart that uses Google Sheets to house the products and uses Handlebars.js and Sheetrock.js to display them. I called it <a href="https://github.com/bradonomics/simplesheets-shopping-cart">SimpleSheets Shopping Cart</a>.</p>

        <p>There are a few other projects and code snippets on <a href="https://github.com/bradonomics/">GitHub</a>.</p>

          <h2>What I'd Like to Do Next</h2>
        </header>

        <p>I've lived in Thailand for seven years. The tech scene in Thailand isn't the same as North America or Western Europe. It is difficult to find work as a non-citizen, most of the companies based in Southeast Asia are doing cheap contract development which is less interesting than working on a product with long-term goals, and there are not as many meetups for intellectual stimulation.</p>

        <p>Continuing to work with WordPress and Jekyll is interesting to me as is the possibility to move into a more back-end roll with Ruby. I'd very much like to find a position that would allow me to work in Europe, or New Zealand, or Australia, but I'm also open to returning to the US and also remote positions.</p>
